        <!-- About Section -->
        <h1>Hi, I'm Ricardo.</h1>
        <p>I invest in early stage startups as a partner at <a href="https://www.pointnine.com" target="_blank">Point Nine</a>.</p>
        <p>My motivation and daily drive come from searching for and defending the new. I've always been obsessed with what the new brings, from uncovering a new song, discovering an up-and-coming artist, or trying the newest tech gadget before anyone else in my youth, to meeting entrepreneurs building the future in my day-to-day work. There's something special about being (one of) the first to discover something and staking it with your opinion, time, and capital.</p>
        <p>I find entrepreneurship to be more of a m√©tier or an artistic endeavor than a science or a job. It's a path taken by people that are driven to bend the future with an expression of themselves.</p>
        <p><i>"Do whatever you do intensely. The artist is the man who leaves the crowd and goes pioneering. With him, there is an idea which is his life"</i><br><i>Robert Henri, The Art Spirit</i></p>
        <p>The entrepreneurial path is full of uncertainty. I don't believe I have the answers to all the questions a founder needs to answer to progress on their journey but I do believe I ask some of the right questions at the right time. Going on the discovery of the truth alongside founders is the essence of my work. That truth can be found in deep research or analysis or by engaging with our network of founders and operators. To align the entrepreneurial path with truth seeking is what enables a company to learn fast and consequently move faster.</p>
