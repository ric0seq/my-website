        <h1>Hi, I'm Ricardo.</h1>
        <p>I invest in early stage startups as a partner at <a href="https://www.pointnine.com" target="_blank">Point Nine</a>.</p>
        <p>My motivation and daily drive come from searching for and defending the new. I've always been obsessed with what the new brings, from uncovering a new song, discovering an up-and-coming artist, or trying the newest tech gadget before anyone else in my youth, to meeting entrepreneurs building the future in my day-to-day work. There's something special about being (one of) the first to discover something and staking it with your opinion, time, and capital.</p>
        <p>I find entrepreneurship to be more of a métier or an artistic endeavor than a science or a job. It's a path taken by people that are driven to bend the future with an expression of themselves.</p>
        <p><i>"Do whatever you do intensely. The artist is the man who leaves the crowd and goes pioneering. With him, there is an idea which is his life"</i><br><i>Robert Henri, The Art Spirit</i></p>
        <p>The entrepreneurial path is full of uncertainty. To align the entrepreneurial path with truth seeking is what enables a company to learn fast and consequently move faster. Going on the discovery of the truth alongside founders is the essence of my work.</p>
