            I'm a GP at <a href="https://www.pointnine.com">Point Nine</a>.

            My daily drive comes from being part of the journeys of the builders of tomorrow.

            I make it my life's mission to go after the discovery of the truth and the defense of the new. Ideas are fragile and those who have them often times just need someone who believes.

            In terms of investment thesis, I spend most of my time trying to learn and understand applications of AI across industries as well as how software is eating the physical world.
