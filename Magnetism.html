        <p>A significant unfair advantage I’ve observed successful startups develop early on is a somewhat elusive magnetism they cultivate around themselves.</p>

        <p>This magnetism generates a powerful field of attraction that unites teams, draws in talent, and pulls customers toward them rather than the other way around. In a world of constant push, push, push—where outbound strategies quickly become exhausted—these companies pull in their direction.</p>

        <p>It all begins with founders who shape both their personal and company narratives from the start. They position themselves and their business within a story that evolves as the company grows. Storytelling reaches its highest level when it becomes memetic, diffusing organically and embedding itself into broader conversations and culture.</p>

        <p>A compelling narrative requires consistency, longevity, and alignment with the market. And it doesn’t follow a single format—sometimes, an idea needs a manifesto; other times, a simple meme captures the message. But no matter the medium, it must always feel honest and authentic. In a post-truth world where marketing materials evoke as much skepticism as mainstream media, being genuine and real go a long way.</p>

        <p>This magnetism becomes even more valuable as companies scale. It keeps your team aligned and motivated through high tides and low tides (and way beyond their initial vest). It helps self-select candidates into a company's hiring funnel—long before you’ve even earned "mafia" status—effectively inverting the talent pipeline in your favor. Would you rather outbound candidates and disqualify 99% of your funnel, or have the right people go above and beyond to be part of your journey?</p>

        <p>Magnetism can also attract customers without full reliance on an ever-scaling sales function. Customers want to buy your product because they identify with your story. They effectively stake their reputation on it and shout out loud to others because they resonate with what the company stands for. When you take a stand and signal the future, you build a real connection with your customer base—and a broader audience.</p>

        <p>This magnetism, attraction, gravitas, or pull all comes down to the work required to build an aspirational company. You can certainly succeed without becoming one, but things get a lot easier when you do.</p>
