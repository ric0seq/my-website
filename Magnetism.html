        <h1>Magnetism</h1>

        <p>A significant unfair advantage I’ve observed successful startups develop early on is a somewhat elusive magnetism they cultivate around themselves.
        This magnetism, fueled by a combination of factors, generates a powerful field of attraction that unites teams, draws in talent, and pulls customers toward them rather than the other way around.</p>

        <p>In a world of constant push, push, push—where outbound strategies quickly become exhausted—these companies can pull stakeholders in their direction.</p>

        <p>It all starts, as always, with founders who shape both their personal and company narratives from day one. They position themselves and their company within a story that evolves as the business matures. It’s not just about the (sometimes superficial) appeal of being mission-driven; it's about mastering the art of storytelling to pave the way for success. A compelling narrative demands consistency, longevity, and proper alignment within the market.</p>

        <p>This magnetism becomes even more valuable as companies scale. It keeps your team aligned and motivated through high and low tides (and way beyond their initial vest). It helps self-select candidates into a company's hiring funnel—long before you’ve even earned "mafia" status—effectively inverting the talent pipeline in your favor. Would you rather outbound candidates and disqualify 99% of your funnel, or have the right people go above and beyond to be part of your journey?</p>

        <p>Magnetism can also attract customers without full reliance on an ever-scaling sales function. Customers want to buy your product because they identify with your story. They effectively stake their reputation on it and shout out loud to others because they resonate with what the company stands for. When you take a stand and signal the future, you build a real connection with your customer base—and a broader audience.</p>

        <p>This magnetism, attraction, gravitas, or pull all comes down to the work required to build an aspirational company. You can certainly succeed without becoming one, but things get a lot easier when you do. Apple has been the most successful company in history at achieving this, but they've been perfecting it for over 40 years.</p>
